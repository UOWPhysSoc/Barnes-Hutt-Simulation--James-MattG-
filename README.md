Barnes-Hutt-Simulation--James-MattG-
====================================

N-body simulation using a Barnes-Hutt algorithm reducing the complexity from O(N^2) to O(N logN).

Written in Python 3.x as a collaboration between Matt Griffiths and James Archer.

Initial concept work by James Archer in Python 2.7.
Concept converted to Python 3 by Matt Griffiths and redesigned to work in a class structure.
Final design tweaks and bug testing by both parties.

Requires VPython module (http://vpython.org/)
Python 3.x version can be obtained here (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
